            </header>

              <p> My hobbies and interests include gaming, weight lifting, tattooing, skateboarding, spending time with my family and, of course, coding! I took interest in coding during hich school and went to college briefly for computer science where I learned the basics of Python and C++. I found that the college route was not for me and decided to give it a go at Thinkful to streamline my education.</p>
              <p> Some things worth knowing about me is that I am a bi-racial, transgender male. With that being said, I strongly value inclusion and diversity. I'd love to be a part of a team where members come from different backgrounds and can work together on a solution that benefits everyone in our targeted audience.</p>
              <p> I pride myself on being a great team player and an ally. If you're open to collaborating or hiring junior developers, please get in touch. I'm excited to step foot into the coding world!</p>
